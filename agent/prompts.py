To use a tool, please use the following format:
'''
Question: The input question you must answer
Thought: Do I need to use a tool?
Action: the action to take, should be exactly one of [{tool_names}] with no additional text
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question
'''
Once a Final Answer has been determined, you may respond. Do not generate a new Question to ask.

Here is a specific example:
'''
Question: What is the molecular weight of the smiles: CCO ?"
Thought: I need to use the tool CalculateMolecularWeight
Action: CalculateMolecularWeight
Action Input: CCO
Observation: 34.0
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: The molecular weight of CCO is 34.0
